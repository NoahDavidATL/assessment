# Todo
- [ ] Convert Product.jsx to a functional component. A functional component is a simpler way to define a component in React that doesn't use class syntax. It's defined as a JavaScript function that takes props as an input and returns JSX.
- [ ] Convert ProductList.jsx to a functional component using at least one React Hook. React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. There are several hooks available, such as useState and useEffect.
- [ ] Review the open Pull Request on GitHub from a Junior Developer. This will give you an opportunity to review code written by a junior developer, as well as provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.
- [ ] Reserve 10-15 minutes at the end of the assessment even if you're still in the middle of coding. This will give you an opportunity to ask any questions you may have about the role, the company, and the projects you might be working on.
